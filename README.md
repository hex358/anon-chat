<h1>AnonChat â€“ Anonymous Telegram Messenger Bot ðŸ”’</h1>
<p>
  An open-source bot designed to provide anonymous messaging features directly within Telegram. Users can send text messages and images, form chat rooms, and personalize their profiles. <br>I used Aiogram3 and MongoDB.
</p>

  Feature list:
  <ul>
    <li>communicate without revealing your identity</li>
    <li>securely send and receive images</li>
    <li>create and manage multi-user conversations</li>
    <li>intuitive interface, consisting only of buttons</li>
</ul>

Some interesting ones:
<ul>
<li>you can download all the messages from your group chat</li>
<li>you can also make your favourite users admins as the chat owner, or ban someone if you're an admin</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I originally developed this to gain experience with Aiogram in 2023. Now that it's open-source, feel free to modify the code and build your own versions of AnonChat in any way you want.
